The methodology used in deriving the canonical \ncoefficients parallels that of a one-way MANOVA. MANOVA tests for equality of the mean \nvector across class levels. Canonical discriminant analysis finds linear combinations of \nthe quantitative variables that provide maximal separation between classes or groups. \nGiven a classification variable and several quantitative variables, the CANDISC procedure \nderives canonical variables, linear combinations of the quantitative variables that summarize \nbetween-class variation in much the same way that principal components summarize total variation. \n\nThe CANDISC procedure performs a canonical discriminant analysis, computes squared Mahalanobis \ndistances between class means, and performs both univariate and multivariate one-way analyses \nof variance. Two output data sets can be produced: one containing the canonical coefficients \nand another containing, among other things, scored canonical variables. The canonical coefficients \noutput data set can be rotated by the FACTOR procedure. It is customary to standardize the canonical \ncoefficients so that the canonical variables have means that are equal to zero and pooled within-class \nvariances that are equal to one. PROC CANDISC displays both standardized and unstandardized canonical \ncoefficients. Correlations between the canonical variables and the original variables as well as the \nclass means for the canonical variables are also displayed; these correlations, sometimes known as \nloadings, are called canonical structures. The scored canonical variables output data set can be \nused in conjunction with ODS Graphics to plot pairs of canonical variables in order to aid visual \ninterpretation of group differences."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ALL","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Activates all of the display options."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"ANOVA","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Displays univariate statistics for testing the hypothesis that the class means are \nequal in the population for each variable."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"BCORR","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Displays between-class correlations."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"BCOV","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Displays between-class covariances."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"BSSCP","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Displays the between-class SSCP matrix."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"DATA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"[Syntax: DATA=SAS-data-set] \n      \nSpecifies the data set to be analyzed.
