The CASECONTROL procedure is designed for the interpretation of marker \ndata when random samples are available from the populations of unrelated individuals \nwho are either affected or unaffected by the disease. Several tests are available in \nPROC CASECONTROL that compare marker allele and/or genotype frequencies in the two \npopulations, with frequency differences indicating an association of the marker with \nthe disease. Although such an association can point to the proximity of the marker \nand disease genes in the genome, it can also reflect population structure, so care \nis needed in interpreting the results; association does not necessarily imply linkage. \n\nThe three chi-square tests available for testing case-control genotypic data are the \ngenotype case-control test, which tests for dominant allele effects on the disease \npenetrance, and the allele case-control test and linear trend test, which test for \nadditive allele effects on the disease penetrance.
