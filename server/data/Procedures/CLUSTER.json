The data can be coordinates or distances.  If the data \nare coordinates, PROC CLUSTER computes (possibly squared) Euclidean distances. If \nyou want non-Euclidean distances, use the DISTANCE procedure to compute an appropriate \ndistance data set that can then be used as input to PROC CLUSTER. \n\nThe clustering methods are: average linkage, the centroid method, complete linkage, \ndensity linkage (including Wong\u2019s hybrid and th-nearest-neighbor methods), maximum \nlikelihood for mixtures of spherical multivariate normal distributions with equal \nvariances but possibly unequal mixing proportions, the flexible-beta method, McQuitty\u2019s \nsimilarity analysis, the median method, single linkage, two-stage density linkage, \nand Ward\u2019s minimum-variance method. \n\nAll methods are based on the usual agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure. \nEach observation begins in a cluster by itself. The two closest clusters are merged \nto form a new cluster that replaces the two old clusters. Merging of the two closest \nclusters is repeated until only one cluster is left.
