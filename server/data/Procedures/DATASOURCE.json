Once stored in a SAS data set, \nthe time series and event variables can be processed by other SAS procedures. \n\nThe DATASOURCE procedure has statements and options to extract only a subset of time series data from \nan input data file. It gives you control over the frequency of data to be extracted, time series variables \nto be selected, cross sections to be included, and time range of data to be output. \n\nThe DATASOURCE procedure can create auxiliary data sets containing descriptive information on the time \nseries variables and cross sections. More specifically, the OUTCONT= option names a data set containing \ninformation on time series variables, the OUTBY= option names a data set that reports information on cross-\nsectional variables, and the OUTALL= option names a data set that combines both time series variables and \ncross-sectional information. \n\nIn addition to the auxiliary data sets, two types of primary output data sets are the OUT= and OUTEVENT= \ndata sets. The OUTEVENT= data set contains event variables but excludes periodic time series data.
