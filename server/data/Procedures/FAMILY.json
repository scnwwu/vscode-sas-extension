Case-control \ndata can uncover significant associations between markers and a disease that could be caused \nby factors other than linkage, such as population structure. Analyzing family data by using \nthe FAMILY procedure ensures that any significant associations found between a marker and \ndisease status are due to linkage between the marker and disease locus. This is accomplished \nby using the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) and several variations of it that can \naccommodate different types of family data. One type of family consists of parents, at least \none heterozygous, and an affected child who have all been genotyped. This family structure is \nsuitable for the original TDT. Families having at least one affected and one unaffected sibling \nfrom a sibship that have both been genotyped can be analyzed using the sibling tests: the sib \nTDT (S-TDT) or the nonparametric sibling disequilibrium test (SDT). Both types of families can \nbe jointly analyzed using the combined versions of the S-TDT and SDT and the reconstruction-\ncombined TDT (RC-TDT).
