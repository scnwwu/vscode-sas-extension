At least one MODEL statement is required. You \ncan specify more than one MODEL statement. Each MODEL statement identifies one or more \ncomponents of a mixture. For example, if components differ in their distributions, link \nfunctions, or regressor variables, then you can use separate MODEL statements to define \nthe components.

Each Bernoulli \ntrial results in either an event or a nonevent (with probability 1-\u03c0). The value of the second \nvariable, trials, gives the number n of Bernoulli trials. The value of the first variable, \nevents, is the number of events out of n. The values of both events and (trialsevents) must be \nnonnegative, and the value of trials must be positive. Other distributions that allow the \nevents/trials syntax are the beta-binomial distribution and the binomial cluster model. \n\nIf the events/trials syntax is used, the FMM procedure defaults to the binomial distribution. \nIf you use the response syntax, the procedure defaults to the normal distribution unless the \nresponse variable is a character variable or listed in the CLASS statement. \n\nThe FMM procedure supports a continuation-style syntax in MODEL statements.
