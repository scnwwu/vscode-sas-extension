PROC FONTREG uses FreeType font-rendering to \nrecognize and incorporate various types of font definitions. Fonts of any type that \ncan be incorporated and used by SAS are known collectively in this documentation as \nfonts in the FreeType library.\n\nNote: Including a system font in the SAS registry means that SAS knows where to find \nthe font file.
