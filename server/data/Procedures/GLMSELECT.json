The procedure also provides graphical summaries of the selection search. \n\nThe GLMSELECT procedure compares most closely to REG and GLM. The REG procedure supports a variety \nof model-selection methods but does not support a CLASS statement. The GLM procedure supports a CLASS \nstatement but does not include effect selection methods. The GLMSELECT procedure fills this gap. \nGLMSELECT focuses on the standard independently and identically distributed general linear model \nfor univariate responses and offers great flexibility for and insight into the model selection \nalgorithm.
