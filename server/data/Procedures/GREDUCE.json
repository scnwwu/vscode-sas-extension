For each observation in the input map \ndata set, the procedure determines the significance of that point for maintaining a semblance \nof the original shape and gives the observation a corresponding DENSITY value.\n\nYou can then use the value of the DENSITY variable to create a subset of the original map data \nset. The observations in the subset can draw a map that retains the overall appearance of the \noriginal map but contains fewer points, requires considerably less storage space, and can be \ndrawn much more quickly.\n\nGREDUCE does not produce any graphics output.
