{"Procedure":{"Name":"HAPLOTYPE","ProductGroup":"SAS/GENETICS","ProcedureHelp":{"#cdata":"Syntax: PROC HAPLOTYPE <options> ; \n    BY variables ; \n    ID variables ; \n    TRAIT variable </ options> ; \n    VAR variables ; \n\nA haplotype is a combination of alleles at multiple loci on a single chromosome. A pair \nof haplotypes constitutes the multilocus genotype. Haplotype information has to be inferred \nbecause data are usually collected at the genotypic, not haplotype pair, level. For homozygous \nmarkers, there is no problem. If one locus has alleles A and a, and a second locus has alleles  \nB and b, the observed genotype AaBB must contain two haplotypes of type AB; genotype AaBB must \ncontain haplotypes AB and aB, and so on. Haplotypes and their frequencies can be obtained directly. \nWhen both loci are heterozygous, however, there is ambiguity; a variety of combinations of haplotypes \ncan generate the genotype, and it is not possible to determine directly which two haplotypes constitute \nany individual genotype. For example, the genotype AaBb might be of type AB/ab with haplotypes AB and\nab, or of type Ab/aB with haplotypes Ab and aB. The HAPLOTYPE procedure uses the expectation-maximization \n(EM) algorithm to generate maximum likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies given a multilocus \nsample of genetic marker genotypes under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). These \nestimates can then be used to assign the probability that each individual possesses a particular \nhaplotype pair. A Bayesian approach for haplotype frequency estimation is also implemented in \nPROC HAPLOTYPE. \n\nEstimation of haplotype frequencies is important for several applications in genetic data analysis. \nOne application is determining whether there is linkage disequilibrium (LD), or association, between \nloci. PROC HAPLOTYPE performs a likelihood ratio test to test the hypothesis of no LD between marker \nloci. Another application is association testing of disease susceptibility. Since sites that affect \ndisease status are embedded in haplotypes, it has been postulated that the power of case-control studies \nmight be increased by testing for haplotype rather than allele or genotype associations. One reason is \nthat haplotypes might include two or more causative sites whose combined effect is measurable, particularly \nif they show synergistic interaction. Another reason is that fewer tests need to be performed, although if \nthere are a large number of haplotypes, this advantage is offset by the increased degrees of freedom of each \ntest. PROC HAPLOTYPE can use case-control data to calculate test statistics for the hypothesis of no association \nbetween alleles composing the haplotypes and disease status; such tests are carried out across all haplotypes \nat the loci specified, or for individual haplotypes."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ALPHA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"[Syntax: ALPHA=number] \n        \n  Specifies that a confidence level of 100(1-number)% is to be used in forming the \n  confidence intervals for estimates of haplotype frequencies.
