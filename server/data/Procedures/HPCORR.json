The correlation statistics include the following: \n\n  o Pearson product-moment correlation \n\nPearson product-moment correlation is a parametric measure of a linear relationship \nbetween two variables. \n\nPolyserial correlation measures the correlation between two continuous variables with \na bivariate normal distribution, where only one variable is observed directly. Information \nabout the unobserved variable is obtained through an observed ordinal variable that is \nderived from the unobserved variable by classifying its values into a finite set of \ndiscrete, ordered values. \n\nA related type of correlation, polychoric correlation, measures the correlation between \ntwo unobserved variables with a bivariate normal distribution. Information about these \nvariables is obtained through two corresponding observed ordinal variables that are derived \nfrom the unobserved variables by classifying their values into finite sets of discrete, \nordered values. Polychoric correlation is not available in the HPCORR procedure, but it \nis available in the FREQ procedure. \n\nWhen only one set of analysis variables is specified, the default correlation analysis \nincludes descriptive statistics for each analysis variable and pairwise Pearson correlation \nstatistics for these variables. \n\nWhen two sets of analysis variables are specified, the default correlation analysis includes \ndescriptive statistics for each analysis variable and pairwise Pearson correlation statistics \nbetween the two sets of variables. \n\nWhen the relationship between two variables is nonlinear or when outliers are present, the \ncorrelation coefficient might incorrectly estimate the strength of the relationship. Plotting \nthe data enables you to verify the linear relationship and to identify the potential outliers. \nIf ODS Graphics is enabled, scatter plots and a scatter plot matrix can be created via the \nOutput Delivery System (ODS). Confidence and prediction ellipses can also be added to the \nscatter plot. \n\nYou can save the correlation statistics in a SAS data set for use with other statistical \nand reporting procedures."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"BEST=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Syntax: BEST=n \n      \nPrints the n highest correlation coefficients for each variable, n \u2265 1.
