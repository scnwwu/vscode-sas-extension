For more information about multilayer perceptron neural networks, see Bishop \n(1995). PROC HPNEURAL can also use the trained network to score the input data set. \n\nPROC HPNEURAL reads and writes data in distributed form and makes full use of multicore \ncomputers and distributed computing environments to perform training and scoring. \n\nTraining a multilayer perceptron neural network requires the unconstrained minimization of a nonlinear\nobjective function. Because there are currently no practical methods to guarantee finding a global minimum\nof that objective function, one way to be reasonably sure of finding a good solution is to train the network\nmultiple times using different sets of initial values for the weights. Thus, even problems with smaller numbers\nof variables and training observations can benefit from the use of multicore computers and distributed\ncomputing environments."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"DATA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Syntax: DATA=SAS-data-set\n      \nNames the SAS data set that contains the training and validation observations to be used by PROC\nHPNEURAL to train the neural network or that contains the observations to be scored when you are\nperforming stand-alone scoring.
