There is roughly one SNP per 1 \nkilobase in the human genome. Studies of human haplotype variations that use SNPs over \nlarge genomic regions suggest the presence of discrete blocks with limited haplotype \ndiversity punctuated by recombination hot spots. The intrablock linkage disequilibrium \n(LD) decreases only gradually with distance, while the interblock LD decays much more \nrapidly. Within each block, because of high LD, some allele(s) might always be coexistent \nwith a particular allele at another locus such that (1) little haplotype diversity exists \nin the block, and (2) not all SNPs will be essential in characterizing the haplotype \nstructure in the block. Therefore, the most common haplotypes could usually be captured \nby a small subset of SNPs, termed haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) by Johnson et al. (2001)."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"CONV=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"[Syntax: CONV=number] \n        \nSpecifies the convergence criterion for search of htSNPs, where 0 < number \u2264 1.
