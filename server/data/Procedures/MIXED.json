A mixed linear \nmodel is a generalization of the standard linear model used in the GLM procedure, the \ngeneralization being that the data are permitted to exhibit correlation and nonconstant \nvariability. The mixed linear model, therefore, provides you with the flexibility of \nmodeling not only the means of your data (as in the standard linear model) but their \nvariances and covariances as well. \n\nThe primary assumptions underlying the analyses performed by PROC MIXED are as follows: \n\n  o The data are normally distributed (Gaussian). \n\n  o The means (expected values) of the data are linear in terms of a certain set of parameters. \n\n  o The variances and covariances of the data are in terms of a different set of parameters, \n    and they exhibit a structure matching one of those available in PROC MIXED."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ABSOLUTE","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Makes the convergence criterion absolute."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"ALPHA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"[Syntax: ALPHA=number] \n      \nRequests that confidence limits be constructed for the covariance parameter estimates \nwith confidence level 1-number.
