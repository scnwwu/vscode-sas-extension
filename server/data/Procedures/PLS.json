Ordinary least squares regression, \nas implemented in SAS/STAT procedures such as PROC GLM and PROC REG, has the single \ngoal of minimizing sample response prediction error, seeking linear functions of the \npredictors that explain as much variation in each response as possible. The techniques \nimplemented in the PLS procedure have the additional goal of accounting for variation \nin the predictors, under the assumption that directions in the predictor space that are \nwell sampled should provide better prediction for new observations when the predictors \nare highly correlated. All of the techniques implemented in the PLS procedure work by \nextracting successive linear combinations of the predictors, called factors (also called \ncomponents, latent vectors, or latent variables), which optimally address one or both \nof these two goals\u2014explaining response variation and explaining predictor variation. \nIn particular, the method of partial least squares balances the two objectives, seeking \nfactors that explain both response and predictor variation."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"CENSCALE","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Lists the centering and scaling information for each response and predictor."},"ProcedureOptionType":"S"},{"ProcedureOptionName":"CV=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Specifies the cross validation method to be used.
