{"Procedure":{"Name":"PSMOOTH","ProductGroup":"SAS/GENETICS","ProcedureHelp":{"#cdata":"Syntax: PROC PSMOOTH <options> ; \n    BY variables ; \n    ID variables ; \n    VAR variables ; \n\nIn the search for complex disease genes, linkage and/or association tests are often \nperformed on markers from a genome-wide scan or SNPs from a finely scaled map. This \nmeans hundreds or even thousands of hypotheses are being simultaneously tested. \nPlotting the negative log p-values of all the marker tests will reveal many peaks \nthat indicate significant test results, some of which are false positives. In order \nto reduce the number of false positives or improve power, smoothing methods can be \napplied that take into account p-values from neighboring, and possibly correlated, \nmarkers. That is, the peak length can be used to indicate significance in addition \nto the peak height. The PSMOOTH procedure offers smoothing methods that implement \nSimes\u2019 method (1986), Fisher\u2019s method (1932), and/or the truncated product method \n(TPM) (Zaykin et al. 2002) for multiple hypothesis testing. These methods modify \nthe p-value from each marker test by using a function of its original p-value and \nthe p-values of the tests on the nearest markers. Since the number of hypothesis \ntests being performed is not reduced, adjustments to correct the smoothed p-values \nfor multiple testing are available as well. \n\nPROC PSMOOTH can take any data set containing any number of columns of p-values as \nan input data set, including the output data sets from the CASECONTROL and FAMILY \nprocedures."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ADJUST=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Indicates which adjustment for multiple testing to apply to the set(s) of p-values in \nthe output data set.
