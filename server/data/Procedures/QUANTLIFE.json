By estimating a set of \nconditional quantiles, you can gain more insight about the conditional distribution of the response \ngiven its covariates. \n\nQuantile regression provides a flexible way to capture heterogeneous effects in the sense that the \ntails and the central location of the conditional distributions can vary differently with the covariates. \nThus, quantile regression offers a powerful tool in survival analysis, where the lifetimes are skewed, \nand extreme survival times can be of special interest (Koenker and Geling, 2001; Huang, 2010)."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ALPHA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Syntax: ALPHA=value \n      \nSpecifies the confidence level for the regression parameters.
