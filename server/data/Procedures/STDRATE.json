For two \nstudy populations with the same reference population, PROC STDRATE compares directly standardized \nrates or risks from these two populations. For homogeneous effects across strata, PROC STDRATE computes \nMantel-Haenszel estimates. The STDRATE procedure also computes indirectly standardized rates and \nrisks, including SMR. \n\nThe attributable fraction measures the excess event rate or risk fraction in the exposed population \nthat can be attributed to the exposure. The rate or risk ratio statistic is required in the attributable \nfraction computation, and the STDRATE procedure estimates the ratio by using either SMR or the rate ratio \nstatistic in the Mantel-Haenszel estimates. \n\nAlthough the STDRATE procedure provides useful summary standardized statistics, standardization is not \na substitute for individual comparisons of stratum-specific estimates. PROC STDRATE provides summary \nstatistics, such as rate and risk estimates and their confidence limits, in each stratum. In addition, \nPROC STDRATE also displays these stratum-specific statistics by using ODS Graphics. \n\nNote that the term standardization has different meanings in other statistical applications. For example, \nthe STDIZE procedure standardizes numeric variables in a SAS data set by subtracting a location measure \nand dividing by a scale measure."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ALPHA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"Syntax: ALPHA=\u03b1 \n      \nRequests that confidence limits be constructed with confidence level 100(1-\u03b1)%, where 0 < \u03b1 < 1. \nThe default is ALPHA=0.05.
