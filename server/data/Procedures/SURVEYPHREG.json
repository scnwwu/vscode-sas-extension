Cox\u2019s semiparametric model is widely used in the \nanalysis of survival data to estimate hazard rates when adequate explanatory variables \nare available. The procedure provides design-based variance estimates, confidence intervals, \nand hypothesis tests concerning the parameters and model effects.\n\nFor statistical inference, PROC SURVEYPHREG incorporates complex survey sample designs, \nincluding designs with stratification, clustering, and unequal weighting. \n\nThe procedure also allows time-dependent explanatory variables. An explanatory variable \nis time-dependent if its value for any given individual can change over time. Time-dependent\nvariables have many useful applications in survival analysis. You can include time-dependent \nvariables such as blood pressure or blood chemistry measures that vary with time during the \ncourse of a study. You can also use time-dependent variables to test the validity of the \nproportional hazards model. \n\nSeveral optimization techniques are available in SURVEYPHREG to maximize the log likelihood. \nHazard ratio estimates can also be obtained along with parameter estimates. Sampling errors \nof the regression parameters and hazard ratios are computed by using either the Taylor series \n(linearization) method or one of the replication (resampling) methods that are based on complex \nsample designs (Binder; 1983; Wolter; 2007; S\u00e4rndal, Swensson, and Wretman; 1992; Binder; 1992; \nLohr; 2009; Fuller; 2009).
