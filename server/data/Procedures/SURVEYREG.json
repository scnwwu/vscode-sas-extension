This procedure \ncan handle complex survey sample designs, including designs with stratification, clustering, \nand unequal weighting. The procedure fits linear models for survey data and computes regression \ncoefficients and their variance-covariance matrix. The procedure also provides significance \ntests for the model effects and for any specified estimable linear functions of the model \nparameters. Using the regression model, the procedure can compute predicted values for the \nsample survey data. \n\nPROC SURVEYREG uses elementwise regression to compute the regression coefficient estimators \nby generalized least squares estimation. The procedure assumes that the regression coefficients \nare the same across strata and primary sampling units (PSUs). To estimate the variance-covariance \nmatrix for the regression coefficients, PROC SURVEYREG uses either the Taylor series (linearization) \nmethod or replication (resampling) methods to estimate sampling errors of estimators, based on complex \nsample designs."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"ALPHA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"[Syntax: ALPHA=\u03b1] \n      \nSets the confidence level for confidence limits.
