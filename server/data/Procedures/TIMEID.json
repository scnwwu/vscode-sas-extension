PROC TIMEID assesses how well a time interval specification fits SAS date or  \ndatetime values, or observation numbers used to index a time series. The time interval \nused in this analysis can be either specified explicitly as input to PROC TIMEID or \ninferred by the procedure based on values of the time ID variable. The TIMEID procedure \nproduces diagnostic information in the form of data sets and ODS tabular and plotted \noutput. These diagnostic results summarize characteristics of the time ID variable that \ncan help determine its use as an index in other time series procedures and solutions. \n\nPROC TIMEID is intended for use as a tool to either identify the time interval of a \nvariable or prepare problematic data sets for use in subsequent time series analyses. \nIn particular, this procedure can be used to investigate inconsistencies between time \nID values and the ID statement options used in other SAS procedures and solutions."},"ProcedureOptions":{"ProcedureOption":[{"ProcedureOptionName":"DATA=","ProcedureOptionHelp":{"#cdata":"[Syntax: DATA=SAS-data-set] \n      \nNames the SAS data set that contains the input data for the procedure.
