You can use this option to help diagnose problems that are caused by incorrect arguments or attribute tables. If you specify the I option, the E option is implied.\n  E\n  prints detailed error messages. Without the E option (or the I option, which supersedes it), the only error message that the CALL MODULE routine generates is \"Invalid argument to function,\" which is usually not enough information to determine the cause of the error. The E option is useful for a production environment, whereas the I option is preferable for a development or debugging environment.\n  H\n  provides brief information about the syntax of the CALL MODULE routine, the attribute file format, and suggested SAS formats and informats. \n\nargument - is one or more arguments to pass to the requested routine.\n\nDetails\nWorking with Attribute Tables\n  The CALL MODULE routine executes a routine that resides in an external library. The routine uses the \n  required module-name argument to identify the name of the library, as well as optional arguments.\n  \n  CALL MODULE builds a parameter list by using the information in the arguments and a routine description \n  and argument attribute table that you define in a separate file. The attribute table is a sequential text \n  file that contains descriptions of the routines that you can invoke with the CALL MODULE routine. The \n  purpose of the table is to define how CALL MODULE interprets its supplied arguments when it builds a \n  parameter list to pass to the external routine. The attribute table contains a description for each \n  external routine that you intend to call, and descriptions of each argument associated with that routine.\n  \n  Before you invoke CALL MODULE, you must define the fileref of SASCBTBL to point to the external file \n  that contains the attribute table. You can name the file whatever you want when you create it. In this way, \n  you use SAS variables and formats as arguments to CALL MODULE and ensure that these arguments are \n  properly converted before being passed to the external routine. If you do not define this fileref, CALL \n  MODULE calls the requested routine without altering the arguments. \n  \nUsing Special Formats with the CALL MODULE Routine\nNumeric Alignment\nBy default, the CALL MODULE routine forces numeric alignment for fields that are defined with the IBw., \nPIBw., and RBw. formats within the SASCBTBL table. Therefore, the fields are padded to provide an \nappropriate 4-byte or 8-byte boundary. Most current compilers expect this alignment.\n\nNew formats were created specifically for the CALL MODULE routine to accommodate routines that were \nbuilt with a compiler that does not expect alignment. These new formats are IBUNALNw., PIBUNALNw., \nand RBUNALNw. Use these formats instead of the IBw., PIBw., and RBw. formats.","Parameter1":"&lt;control-string","Description1":"\n      Is an optional control string whose first character must be an asterisk (*), followed by any\n      combination of the following characters:\n      I prints the hexadecimal representations of all arguments to the CALL MODULE routine.\n      E prints detailed error messages\n      H provides brief information about the syntax of the CALL MODULE routine, the attribute \n      file format, and suggested SAS formats and informats.","Parameter2":"&gt;module-name&lt;","Description2":"Is the name of the external module to use.","Parameter3":"argument-1, ..., argument-n&gt;","Description3":"Is one or more arguments to pass to the requested routine."},{"Name":"POKE","Definition":"Writes a value directly into memory on a 32-bit platform.","Parameter1":"source","Description1":"Specifies a character constant, variable, or expression that contains a value to write into memory.","Parameter2":"pointer","Description2":"Specifies a character string that contains the virtual address of the data that the CALL POKE routine alters.","Parameter3":"&lt;length&gt;","Description3":"Specifies a numeric constant, variable, or expression that contains the number of bytes to write from the source to the address that is indicated by pointer.","Parameter4":"&lt;floating-point&gt;","Description4":"Specifies that the value of source is stored as a floating-point number.
