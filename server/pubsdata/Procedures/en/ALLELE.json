{"name":"ALLELE","statements":[{"name":"PROC ALLELE","description":"The ALLELE procedure performs preliminary analyses on genetic marker data. These analyses serve to characterize the markers themselves or the population from which they were sampled, and can also serve as the basis for joint analyses on markers and traits. A genetic marker is any heritable unit that obeys the laws of transmission genetics, and the analyses presented here assume the marker genotypes are determined without error. With an underlying assumption of random sampling, the analyses rest on the multinomial distribution of marker alleles, and many standard statistical techniques can be invoked with little modification. The ALLELE procedure uses the notation and concepts described by Weir (1996); this is the reference for all equations and methods not otherwise cited.","help":"PROC ALLELE <ALLELEMIN=number> <ALPHA=number> <BOOTSTRAP=number> <CORRCOEFF> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DELIMITER=’string’> <DELTA> <DPRIME> <GENOCOL> <GENOMIN=number> <HAPLO=NONE | EST | GIVEN... > <HAPLOMIN=number> <INDIVIDUAL=variable> <LOGNOTE> <MARKER=variable> <MAXDIST=number> <NDATA=SAS-data-set> <NOFREQ> <NOPRINT> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PERMS=number | EXACT=number> <PREFIX=prefix> <PROPDIFF> <RHO> <SEED=number> <TALL> <YULESQ>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tPOP <FPERMS=number> <INDIVLOCI> <ZEROF> ...;\n    \n\tVAR variables ;\n    \n\tWITH variables ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALLELEMIN=","optional":true,"aliases":["AMIN="],"description":"Indicates that only alleles with a frequency greater than or equal to number should be included in the \"Allele Frequencies\" table.
