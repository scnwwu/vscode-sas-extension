{"name":"FAMILY","statements":[{"name":"PROC FAMILY","description":"Family genotype data, though more difficult to collect, often provide a more effective way of testing markers for association with disease status than case-control data. Case-control data can uncover significant associations between markers and a disease that could be caused by factors other than linkage, such as population structure. Analyzing family data by using the FAMILY procedure ensures that any significant associations found between a marker and disease status are due to linkage between the marker and disease locus. This is accomplished by using the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) and several variations of it that can accommodate different types of family data. One type of family consists of parents, at least one heterozygous, and an affected child who have all been genotyped. This family structure is suitable for the original TDT. Families having at least one affected and one unaffected sibling from a sibship that have both been genotyped can be analyzed using the sibling tests: the sib TDT (S-TDT) or the nonparametric sibling disequilibrium test (SDT). Both types of families can be jointly analyzed using the combined versions of the S-TDT and SDT and the reconstruction- combined TDT (RC-TDT). The RC-TDT can additionally accommodate families with no unaffected children and missing parental genotypes in certain situations.","help":"PROC FAMILY <COMBINE> <CONTCORR> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DELIMITER=’string’> <GENOCOL> <MULT=JOINT | MAX> <NDATA=SAS-data-set> <OUTQ=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PERMS=number> <PREFIX=prefix> <RCTDT> <SDT> <SEED=number> <SHOWALL> <STDT> <TDT>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tID variables ;\n    \n\tTRAIT <AFFECTED=value> ;\n    \n\tVAR variables ;\n    \n\tXLVAR <SEX=variable> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"COMBINE","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that the combined versions of the S-TDT and SDT be performed.
