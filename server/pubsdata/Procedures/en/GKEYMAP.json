{"name":"GKEYMAP","statements":[{"name":"PROC GKEYMAP","description":"The GKEYMAP procedure creates key maps and device maps that compensate for differences between the way that characters are encoded internally bySAS/GRAPH software and the way that they are encoded by different operating environments and output devices. † In addition, the GKEYMAP procedure can create SAS data sets from existing key maps and device maps, either Institute-supplied or user-generated. This capability is useful when you want to make minor alterations in a large key map or device map and you do not want to or cannot re-create the original data set with a DATA step. † The Institute supplies key maps for many keyboard configurations and operating-environment character representations. Your SAS Software Consultant should have selected the appropriate key map for your site. If the Institute-supplied device maps and key maps do not meet your needs, you can use this procedure to modify an existing map or create a new one.","help":"PROC GKEYMAP &lt;DATA=keymap-data-set&gt; &lt;DEVICE=device-name&gt; &lt;DEVMAP&gt; &lt;MULTFONT&gt; &lt;NAME=map-name&gt; &lt;OUT=output-data-set&gt; &lt;TYPE=MAP11 | MAP1N&gt;; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Identifies the input data set for the GKEYMAP procedure.
