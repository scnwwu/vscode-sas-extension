{"name":"HPTMINE","statements":[{"name":"PROC HPTMINE","description":"The HPTMINE procedure is a high-performance procedure that analyzes large-scale textual data. PROC HPTMINE provides the SAS High-Performance Analytics platform an essential capability for text mining and supports a wide range of fundamental text analysis features, which include tokenizing, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, noun group extraction, default or customized stop or start lists, entity parsing, multiword tokens, synonym lists, term weighting, term-by-document matrix creation, and dimension reduction by term filtering and singular value decomposition (SVD). † PROC HPTMINE integrates the functionalities provided by the TGPARSE, TMUTIL, and SPSVD procedures from SAS Text Miner, and achieves high efficiency and scalability through parallel processing. The HPTMINE procedure can also generate results that can be used to facilitate scoring by the HPTMSCORE procedure. These results include a configuration data set, a term data set, and a data set that contains the SVD projection matrix. † You can use the HPTMINE procedure to read data in distributed form and perform text analysis in parallel in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) or massively parallel processing (MPP) mode. † The following list summarizes the basic features of PROC HPTMINE: † o Functionalities that are related to document parsing, term-by-document matrix creation, and dimension reduction are integrated into one procedure to process data more efficiently. o Parsing supports essential natural language processing (NLP) features, which include tokenizing, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, noun group extraction, default or customized stop or start lists, entity parsing, multiword tokens, synonym lists. o Term weighting and filtering are supported for term-by-document matrix creation. o Parsing and term-by-document matrix creation is parallelized. o Computation of singular value decomposition (SVD) is parallelized.","help":"PROC HPTMINE &lt;DATA=SAS-data-set | DOC=SAS-data-set&gt; &lt;NOPRINT&gt;;     \n\tDOC_ID &lt;DUPLICATIONCHECK | DUPCHK&gt; ;\n    \n\tPARSE &lt;CELLWGT=&lt;LOG | NONE&gt;&gt; &lt;ENTITIES=&lt;STD | NONE&gt;&gt; &lt;MULTITERM=OS-file-reference&gt; ...;\n    \n\tPERFORMANCE &lt;COMMIT=n&gt; &lt;CPUCOUNT=&lt;ACTUAL | &lt;num&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;DATASERVER=“name”&gt; ...;\n    \n\tSVD &lt;K=k&gt; &lt;MAX_K=n&gt; &lt;OUTDOCPRO=SAS-data-set&gt; ...;\n    \n\tVARIABLE|VAR variable ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"aliases":["DOC="],"description":"Names the input SAS data set of documents to be used by PROC HPTMINE.
