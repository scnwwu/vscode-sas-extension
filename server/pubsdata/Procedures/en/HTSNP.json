{"name":"HTSNP","statements":[{"name":"PROC HTSNP","description":"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most abundant form of genetic variation and accounts for about 90% of human DNA polymorphism. There is roughly one SNP per 1 kilobase in the human genome. Studies of human haplotype variations that use SNPs over large genomic regions suggest the presence of discrete blocks with limited haplotype diversity punctuated by recombination hot spots. The intrablock linkage disequilibrium (LD) decreases only gradually with distance, while the interblock LD decays much more rapidly. Within each block, because of high LD, some allele(s) might always be coexistent with a particular allele at another locus such that (1) little haplotype diversity exists in the block, and (2) not all SNPs will be essential in characterizing the haplotype structure in the block. Therefore, the most common haplotypes could usually be captured by a small subset of SNPs, termed haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) by Johnson et al. (2001).","help":"PROC HTSNP <CONV=number> <CRITERION=PDE | RSQH> <CUTOFF=number> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <MAXSIZE=number> <METHOD=INCREMENTAL|INCR | DECREMENTAL|DECR | EXHAUSTIVE|EX... > <NOSUMMARY> <SCHEDULE=number> <SEED=number> <SIZE=number> <STEP=number> <TEMPERATURE=number> <TFACTOR=number>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tFREQ variable ;\n    \n\tVAR variables ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"CONV=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the convergence criterion for search of htSNPs, where 0 < number ≤ 1.
